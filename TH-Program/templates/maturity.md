| **Hypothesis** | **Desc:** "Gut feel." Based on a single CTI report or "what if..." <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` No documentation exists for the hypothesis. | **Desc:** "Reactive." A hypothesis is created *in response* to an event and documented in one place. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** The `CTH Hunt Tracker` list has a `Hypothesis` column. <br/> `*` **Process:** This column is set to **Required**. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** 100% of hunts in the last 30 days have a non-blank `Hypothesis` field. | **Desc:** "Proactive." A **standard process** for *developing* hypotheses is documented and followed. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** A wiki/document (`Hypothesis_Generation_Process.docx`) exists in SharePoint. <br/> `*` **Process:** This doc *must* define proactive sources (e.g., CTI, Splunk Dashboard gaps, SnapAttack gaps). <br/> `*` **Evidence:** `CTH Hunt Tracker` list shows new hunts being created from these proactive sources. | **Desc:** "Prioritized." Hypotheses are formally scored and ranked to decide what to hunt next. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** A `Priority` column (e.g., 1-4) is added to the `CTH Hunt Tracker` list. <br/> `*` **Process:** A bi-weekly "Hunt Planning" meeting is on the team calendar. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** Meeting minutes (or the tracker itself) show that "Draft" hunts are being prioritized and executed in that order. | **Desc:** "Coverage-Driven." Our *detection library* (SnapAttack) and *coverage map* (Splunk) are used to find gaps. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Process:** A formal, quarterly review of our **Splunk MITRE Dashboard** is scheduled. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** The output of this review is a set of new, high-priority "Detection Gap" hypotheses added to the `CTH Hunt Tracker`. |
| **Hunt Plan** | **Desc:** "In the analyst's head." The hunt *is* the plan. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` No plan is written down. | **Desc:** "Documented." A plan (e.g., Word document) is created and *attached* to the `CTH Hunt Tracker` item. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** Our document templates (e.g., `CTI-Based_Template.docx`) exist in a known SharePoint folder. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** The `CTH Hunt Tracker` item has the completed plan file *attached* to the list item. | **Desc:** "Reusable." Our templates are stored in a central, version-controlled **SharePoint Document Library**. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** A **"CTH Plan Library"** (as a new SharePoint Document Library) **is created**. <br/> `*` **Process:** Completed plans are saved here. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** The `CTH Hunt Tracker` list uses a *Hyperlink* column to link to the *specific plan* in that library. | **Desc:** "Measured." Hunt plans are mapped to ATT&CK to measure *hunt coverage*. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** The `CTH Hunt Tracker` list has a **required** `MITRE ATT&CK TTPs` column. <br/> `*` **Process:** This field is populated for all new hunts. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** **Our Splunk MITRE Dashboard** successfully ingests this data to visualize hunt coverage. | **Desc:** "Dynamic." Plans are *updated* with new CTI or findings to keep them evergreen. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Process:** The official "Hunt Close-Out" process includes a step: "Update original hunt plan if needed." <br/> `*` **Evidence:** We can show the **"Version History"** on 3+ plans in SharePoint, with a comment like "Updated query based on finding F-123." |
| **Collect Data** | **Desc:** "Blind." Analyst finds out data is missing *during* the hunt. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Evidence:** A hunt fails *after* it starts because the data is bad or non-existent. | **Desc:** "Checklist." The hunt plan template includes a "Data Sources Required" section. The analyst *fills it out*. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Evidence:** The "Data Sources" section of 5+ completed hunt plans is non-blank. | **Desc:** "Aware." The Hunt Team *uses* the **Data Source Inventory** provided by the SIEM/EDR team. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Process:** Our team's central documentation *links* to the SIEM team's inventory. <br/> `*` **Process:** The hunt plan includes a "checked against inventory" checkbox. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** We can prove a hunt was *not* started because the inventory showed the data was missing. | **Desc:** "Validating." The Hunt Team *checks* the SIEM/EDR team's **Data Health Dashboard** before a hunt. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** The `CTH Hunt Tracker` list has a `Data Health Checked: Yes/No` field. <br/> `*` **Process:** Our formal hunt procedure document *requires* this check. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** This field is "Yes" for all new hunts. | **Desc:** "Driving." The Hunt Team *drives* the data strategy by providing a prioritized list of data gaps. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Process:** A formal, recurring (e.g., quarterly) meeting/report exists where the Hunt Team presents "Top 10 Data Gaps" to the SIEM/EDR team. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** We can show the meeting invite and the "Top 10 Gaps" (PPT/Word) artifact. |
| **Analyze Data** | **Desc:** "Scrolling." Manually "eyeballing" or `grep`-ing through logs. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Evidence:** The only tool used is the search bar. | **Desc:** "Standard Queries." The analyst runs pre-defined queries *from the hunt plan*. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Evidence:** The `Analytic Queries` section of the hunt plan document is filled out. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** The Splunk search history matches the queries from the plan. | **Desc:** "Using the Library." The hunt *starts* by checking the `CTH Analytics Tracker` / SnapAttack for existing queries. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Process:** The `CTH Analytics Tracker` list is used and maintained. <br/> `*` **Process:** Analysts *link* to the SnapAttack analytic from their `CTH Hunt Tracker` item. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** The `CTH Hunt Tracker` has a "Link to SnapAttack" column, and it is in use. | **Desc:** "Refining the Library." The *output* of a hunt is a new or improved analytic. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Process:** The `CTH Analytics Tracker` / SnapAttack has fields for **TP/FP ratio** or "Effectiveness" that are being updated. <br/> `*` **Artifact:** The `CTH Hunt Tracker` has a `New Analytic Created: Yes/No` field. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** We can show 3+ hunts that resulted in a "Yes" and a link to the new analytic. | **Desc:** "Alert-Driven." The Hunt Team's primary job shifts from *manual hunting* to investigating *alerts fired from* the analytics in SnapAttack. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Evidence:** The `CTH Hunt Tracker` list has a "Source" column. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** The primary source for new hunts becomes "Automated Alert" rather than "Manual Hunt." |
| **Escalate Findings** | **Desc:** "Teams chat." Ad-hoc, verbal notification. Not trackable. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Evidence:** No formal finding is logged. | **Desc:** "Formal Handoff." A finding is formally logged in the `CTH Findings` list. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** The `CTH Findings` list exists. <br/> `*` **Process:** The IR team has access to this list. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** 100% of findings are logged here. | **Desc:** "Standardized Handoff." The `CTH Findings` list has **required fields** that map to the IR team's needs. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** The `CTH Findings` list *form* (the 'New Item' screen) shows that `Evidence` and `Analysis Steps` are **required fields** (marked with a red asterisk). | **Desc:** "Measured Handoff." Timelines are tracked (e.g., "Mean Time to Escalate," "IR Acknowledgment Time"). <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** An `IR Acknowledged Time` (Date/Time) column is added to the `CTH Findings` list. <br/> `*` **Process:** The IR team is trained to fill this out. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** A report/dashboard exists showing the average time between `Created` and `IR Acknowledged Time`. | **Desc:** "Automated Handoff." A SOAR playbook is triggered. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** A Power Automate/SOAR flow *exists* that reads from the `CTH Findings` list. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** This flow *automatically* creates a ticket in the IR system (e.g., ServiceNow) when a new finding is created. |
| **Reporting** | **Desc:** "Nothing." Results are not documented, especially if nothing is found. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Evidence:** `CTH Hunt Tracker` items are left open or have no closing notes. | **Desc:** "Archival." The `CTH Hunt Tracker` item is formally closed with notes. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** The `CTH Hunt Tracker` has a `Status` column (e.g., "Closed - Finding," "Closed - No Finding"). <br/> `*` **Evidence:** 100% of completed hunts are formally closed. | **Desc:** "Stakeholder." A standard report (PPT, email) is *manually* created and sent to stakeholders monthly/quarterly. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Artifact:** A "Monthly Hunt Summary" PowerPoint template exists. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** A folder exists containing at least two "Monthly Hunt Summary" reports (e.g., `Hunt_Summary_Oct.pptx`, `Hunt_Summary_Nov.pptx`). | **Desc:** "Dashboard." **Our Splunk MITRE Dashboard** is the central, live report. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Process:** The `Splunk MITRE Dashboard` is *enhanced* (or linked to another) to also show: "Hunts Run," "Findings by TTP," and "Hunt vs. Detection Coverage." <br/> `*` **Evidence:** The dashboard is live and accessible to the team. | **Desc:** "Strategic." The dashboard is *used* to drive strategy. <br/><br/> **Definition of Done (DoD):** <br/> `*` **Process:** The monthly hunt planning meeting *actively uses* the **Splunk MITRE Dashboard** to find gaps. <br/> `*` **Evidence:** Meeting minutes or new "Draft" hypotheses in the tracker show a direct link (e.g., "Hypothesis created to address T1539 gap identified on Splunk dashboard"). |
